## 2026-10-13 · fact-checker · Pass 7: 45 lessons checked, 191 claims verified, 0 disputed
- Changed: verified the 4 reworded claims (one-in-four-sprouts c3, saturated-enzyme c2/c3, point-one-is-26-percent c5), builder-flagged claims (red-apple-green-light, filament-vs-led-heat, paper-stops-alpha, pay-first-then-profit, geography ISS/GPS/geostationary, antarctica areas, city coordinates), all of geography except half-of-humanity, 10 probability and 14 economics lessons. Records appended as "Pass 7" in company/reviews/<slug>/2026-10-13-fact-check.md. salt-ions-count-double c5 still says "about 3.5": left unverified.
- Believe now (high): every verified claim re-derived in node (model.ts run directly, d3-geo walks re-run on the kit data). Soft spots: c5 of antarctica-vs-australia names the CIA Factbook for 7.69 (Factbook gives 7.74; Geoscience Australia gives 7.692); the source line should say so.
- Next (builder): salt-ions c5 to "about 3.4". Next (fact-checker): the rest, mainly ai, chemistry, cs, life, math, physics, 10 more probability lessons (a-birthday-like-mine ... two-random-walks-agree), economics twenty-then-ten-off.
- Blocked: half-of-humanity c1 (population.un.org unreachable).

## 2026-10-13 · platform-engineer · SPIKE-001: lessons in a sandboxed cross-origin iframe (W-074)
- Changed: new spike/ (builder, kit entry and bridge, CDN server, manifest and rollback tools, measure script, QA contract copy, security spec, hostile fixture) and the src/app/spike route; company/engineering/spikes/SPIKE-001-frontend-sandbox.md + SPIKE-001-results.json; platform-engineer findings in the EDD-003 review record; README index; changelog; spike/dist gitignored. No feed, lesson page, kit, gate, tests/qa or lesson source changed. No new dependency (Next's vendored webpack and terser, plus typescript and postcss). W-074 → review; W-077..W-080 added.
- Believe now (and how sure): go with changes for stage 1. Measured in Chromium emulation on a loaded machine: lessons 2.2–2.5 KB gz (all 348 ≤ 8.3 KB), kit 61.8 KB gz, geo kit 71 KB gz, cold insert→ready ≤ 1.1 s even at 4× CPU, memory 0.85× today's feed (high confidence). The negative security test passes with a positive control (high). The QA contract works through frameLocator, 6/6 (high). Warm remount is 0.2–0.7 s, so the "warm" budget needs redefining (medium). iOS and real devices are untested (unknown).
- Next (owner): real-device run (platform-engineer, W-077); separate lesson domain plus CSP header (privacy-reviewer, W-078); QA-through-frame amendment (evaluation-steward, W-079); bundler decision record (platform-engineer, W-080); principal-engineer closes the review.
- Blocked: nothing. To reproduce, see the end of the spike doc.

## 2026-10-13 · principal-engineer · EDD-003 lesson storage and loading at scale (design only)
- Changed: company/engineering/edd/EDD-003-lesson-storage-at-scale.md (new), company/rituals/records/2026-10-13-eng-review-lesson-storage.md (open), EDD index line in company/engineering/README.md, board W-074..W-076. No code, gates or protected paths touched; build ran in .next-pe (removed), tsconfig.json restored.
- Believe now (and how sure): measured at 348 lessons: 73 s build, 321 MB output, 4.26 MB packed git, 6.8 files/lesson, 6.6 s QA wall/lesson. The feed HTML (1.82 MB) and the all-metas chunk on every page (1.29 MB) are already over budget (high confidence, measured). One app build and full-catalog QA break at 2k–10k; plain git near 100k (medium, linear extrapolation). Recommend client-side content-hashed bundles in a sandboxed cross-origin iframe, with the server serving manifest, meta and previews; never server-side lesson code (high on the direction, medium on the iframe host until the spike).
- Next (owner): platform-engineer runs the 3-lesson spike (W-074) and fixes EDD-001 (W-076); the invited reviewers answer the questions in the review record (W-075); the founder answers the 7 questions in EDD-003.
- Blocked: gate changes need amendments drafted by the evaluation steward; the bundler choice needs a decision record.

## 2026-10-13 · platform-engineer / release-manager (Codex implementation) · GitHub deployment pipeline
- Changed: .github/workflows/deploy.yml; automatic previews after successful default-branch CI, manual production on the default branch, immutable release checkout, scoped environment credentials, pinned actions and release artifacts. The deploy command now supports --prebuilt (verify, pull, local build, upload, smoke, promote).
- Believe now (and how sure): 17 deployment tests and actionlint/shell/deployment-boundary checks pass; local Vercel builders receive no authentication token (high confidence in orchestration). Cloud upload/promotion still needs configured GitHub/Vercel credentials.
- Next (owner): principal-engineer reviews the PR; founder/release-manager configures preview-deploy and production environments with Vercel IDs and token, then uses the workflow.
- Blocked: the checkout has no Git push credentials; the explicitly authorized upload uses the connected GitHub account. No live deployment requested or created.

## 2026-10-13 · platform-engineer / release-manager (Codex implementation) · executable Vercel deployment
- Changed: tools/deploy.mjs, npm deploy/test:deploy commands, /deploy, release-manager onboarding and runbook; Vercel CLI pinned at 63.1.2. Production visibility now covers map and standalone URLs. EDD-002, decision and implementation-review records accompany the PR.
- Believe now (and how sure): the workflow blocks promotion on failed checks (13 orchestration tests); the updated preview works (646/646 browser QA), and the production build shows 47 published cards and returns 404 on all 271 unpublished lesson URLs (high confidence in local behavior; cloud upload/promotion not exercised).
- Next (owner): principal-engineer reviews the PR; release-manager uses npm run deploy -- preview after one-time Vercel login/link. Production is explicit and stages before promotion.
- Blocked: no linked Vercel project in this checkout; no live deployment attempted. Existing four disputed-claim warnings remain in the review queue.

## 2026-10-13 · fact-checker · second independent pass: Part A (9 prior fact-checker claims + 4 more) and Part B (economics, math, physics, life, geography, probability)
- Changed: statuses and checkedBy/checkedOn on about 270 claims across 57 lessons (11 disputed, 1 left unverified); fact-check sections appended to company/reviews/<slug>/2026-10-13-fact-check.md. No Demo.tsx edits, no claims added.
- Disputed (reasons in each review file): ai/border-follows-point c5, ai/clicks-not-value c5, ai/draw-the-xor-lines c5, ai/gradient-descent c11, ai/meaning-without-the-word c5, ai/penalty-on-wiggle c5, ai/temperature-reshapes c8, economics/two-bets-split c7, geography/fingernail-ocean c2, life/vaccinate-at-the-peak c3, math/rabbit-ratio c4.
- Left unverified: geography/half-of-humanity c1 (UN WPP 2024 table unreachable: population.un.org, data.un.org, Wikipedia and OWID were blocked from this session; only partial corroboration).
- Believe now: numbers re-derived in node from the Demo.tsx model code (kit/geo shapes, SIR/SIRS, throw-it-fast-enough model.ts); high confidence. Source checks by web search for Peeperkorn 2024, Lewis 2020, AP style, Bishop Museum (Lahaina Noon), Ledyard 1995 (secondary only), UL 489 trip times (secondary only).
- Next: demo-builder fixes the 11 disputed wordings (board W-058); fact-checker with network access compares half-of-humanity c1 (W-059). Advisory wording notes (not blocking) are in the review files: horizon-ruler refraction 'a few per cent' (about 8%), sieve 'clear a hundred numbers', friends-have-more-friends c3 'wherever friend counts differ' is false for disconnected networks, throw-it-fast-enough ISS 7.7 vs NASA 7.8 km/s.
- Blocked: none.

## 2026-10-13 (night) · chief-of-staff · 504 lessons: past the 500 target
- **Changed:**
  - Lessons went from 328 to 504 this evening, with every domain except Life Hacks at or near the end of its brief list.
  - New orgs and roles: Life Hacks, Personalization, International, Design, 27 sub-area category managers, the Principal PM for verticals, and the CEO-office chief of staff (Leonie). That is 72 roles in total.
  - The work queue (`tools/claim.mjs`), the walkthrough contact sheets and the publish loop.
  - HQ now has 3 floors.
  - Agent metrics are in the WBR.
  - SPIKE-001 came back "go with changes".
- **Believe now:**
  - 504 lessons is a count of lessons built and QA'd, not of good lessons (high confidence). Roughly 80 are published. Most of the rest have no learner review yet or a "revise" verdict, and about 415 claims are still unverified (two fact-checkers are on them).
  - The quality loop is the bottleneck, not building: the launch rate is about 37% on first review.
  - 53 of 72 roles have never been dispatched. Leonie is evaluating that now.
- **Next:**
  1. Leonie's role evaluation and handoff map: the founder decides on her proposals.
  2. Finish fact-check pass 8 and the reviews, then run the publish loop.
  3. Hand QA and publishing back to qa-tester and release-manager.
  4. Run the accessibility review (W-057).
  5. EXP-003 result: Sonnet vs Opus builders.
  6. Design review of new briefs.
- **Blocked (founder):**
  - backend choices (auth provider, database host, under-13 policy);
  - usage budget;
  - AMD-001;
  - UN WPP and Bullard source checks;
  - the Personalization brief;
  - the image-generation agent setup (waiting for a yes).
- **Tooling note:** builders report that the claim schema rejects support "citation", so they use "source". Either document "source" as the type for citations in demo-standard, or propose adding "citation" (the gate is constitutional).

## 2026-10-13 (evening) · chief-of-staff · Three new teams; HQ live locally; 328 lessons
- Changed:
  - New teams: backend (backend-engineer, privacy-reviewer), growth (growth-designer) and company tools (tools-lead, hq-engineer). Decision record: company/decisions/2026-10-13-three-new-teams.md.
  - Event log: company/ops/events.jsonl plus tools/events.mjs, backfilled with about 590 events from git and session transcripts.
  - HQ at /hq: floor plan, replay, timeline, Lobby with due rituals and founder items.
  - Event-driven ritual triggers: company/rituals/triggers.json and tools/rituals-due.mjs.
  - Merged chemistry wave 4 and the pass-4 claim fixes. Check: 0 warnings.
- Believe now:
  - HQ works locally (screenshots on desktop, phone and replay; high confidence). It is off in production unless HQ_PUBLIC=1.
  - The usage limit is the binding constraint: it stopped all 8 agents for about 7 hours.
- Next (chief-of-staff):
  - Merge the resumed agents (ai w4, geography w4 builders; life reviser; economics, cs, geography reviewers).
  - Run the publish loop, then the rituals that are due (retro, demo crit, the first founder digest).
  - A fact-check pass for chemistry w4, probability w3, geography w3 and the 5 claim fixes.
- Blocked (founder):
  - Backend choices: auth provider, database host, under-13 policy.
  - Budget split between lessons and the new teams.
  - AMD-001 ratification.
  - UN WPP and Bullard source checks.

## 2026-10-13 (late) · chief-of-staff · 248 lessons; wave 4 under way
- Changed: merged wave 3 (ai, chemistry, life) and CS wave 2, for 248 lessons and 1,300 claims; check passes (6 disputed-claim warnings). The walkthrough driver now follows the QA path (each control once, in DOM order, 1.2 s settle). Running: builders for geography w2, physics w4, math w4, economics w4 and cs w3 (5 Opus, the cap), plus a fact-checker on ai/chemistry/cs.
- Believe now: about 20k build tokens per lesson holds (cs w2: 196k for 10). The learner launch rate of about 11% is the real constraint, not build throughput (medium-high confidence). Only 2 lessons are published.
- Next (chief-of-staff): merge builders as they report; once the integrated QA finishes, qa-record and publish the launch-verdict lessons; regenerate walkthroughs and dispatch learner reviewers per domain; revision builders for "revise" findings; WBR and retro for waves 2–4.
- Blocked: AMD-001 (a–d), the OP and the usage budget wait on the founder, as do the human source checks (UN WPP, Bullard 1965).

## 2026-10-13 · chief-of-staff · 178 lessons merged; usage-limit COE; checks resuming
- Changed: waves 1 and 2 (7 domains) merged, plus revisions of all 18 founding lessons (every fatal fixed). Kit: <Milestones>, mulberry32, reveal layout fix, turbopack worktree root. Integrated QA last run 226/226 (before wave 2's 70 merged).
- Believe now: builders cost about 20k tokens per lesson, and checking is the bottleneck. 150+ lessons have no learner review. Wave 3 builders (econ, chem, physics, math) resumed via SendMessage; life, ai, cs-w2 and geo-w2 are still stopped with partial work in their worktrees.
- Next (chief-of-staff): when the resumed builders report, resume life, ai, cs-w2 and geo-w2 (max 4 Opus at once). After the fact-checkers: learner reviews per domain, then publish what passes. Then a full verify on the integrated tree, a WBR and the wave 2 retro.
- Blocked: AMD-001 and the OP need the founder's ratification. A usage budget is unknown (COE action).

## 2026-10-12 · chief-of-staff · Founding session: company, app and first 17 lessons
- Changed: built the feed app and lesson kit, the company handbook (26 roles/25 agents, constitution, 13 rituals, PM system, patterns, experiments), the CLI and computer-use QA. Four parallel builders made 16 lessons across 8 domains; merge-sort-payoff is the exemplar. Fact-check and a simulated-learner review were run on merge-sort-payoff.
- Believe now: all 17 lessons pass the QA contract on phone and desktop (44/44). That means they work, not that they teach (high confidence that they work, no evidence that they teach). The merge-sort learner review found the stage never shows why splitting helps (W-014). Expect similar "told, not shown" findings elsewhere.
- Next: fact-check the remaining 16 lessons (W-001, fact-checker). Run learner reviews from walkthroughs (W-002). First Demo Crit, then launch reviews; nothing is published yet. Run the first WBR and OP.
- Blocked: real-learner evidence needs the founder (EXP-002, W-007). The kit's `next build` with NEXT_DIST_DIR rewrites tsconfig.json; revert it, don't commit it.
