# Build note: choose-the-metric-first

## Revision v2, W9 (r11 fix plan, 2026-10-15, demo-builder)

Input: the W9 row of company/decisions/2026-10-15-lifehacks-r11-fix-plan.md and this lesson's r11 learner review.

**What changed**
- Kept the question. The reveal no longer mentions prerequisites (TP-5 shows the dependency readout only when a lesson has one) or "animation" (removed from the principle, c2 reset). TP-8: the options are reordered so that the right one is second.
- The version was already bumped to v2 by the TP-4/TP-5 template change on this branch, and is not bumped twice.

**Claims** (none marked verified by me): c1 verified, c2 unverified, c3 unverified, recall verified.

## Pre-flight v2
1. **Title and hook:** unchanged ("Choose the metric first" / "A queue can look better by one score and worse by another."). The title states the answer; cm content.
2. **Options:** "Count visible movement", "Choose the objective".
3. **Locked stage:** the queue, readouts "?".
4. **Reveal values:** every number in the first reveal sentence is computed from the learner's final layout or order. The milestones are "Test plan"/"Run queue" and the lesson's button.
5. **QA path:** the first button, the lesson's button, then the slider (schedule) or the swaps (queue). Both milestones are reached, and the final state is on screen at the reveal.
6. **Reset:** there is no Reset control, and the reveal reads the current state.
7. **Phone fit:** reveal-fit 390×844 (committed tool, clean stamp, dev server; it commits the first option): verdict fit, crop 0 px, hiddenBelow 0 px, 57 words, phoneFit true.

**Checks** (worktree /home/user/s3c-lh-study, branch lh-study, dev server :3711): QA contract phone and desktop (`QA_BASE_URL`, the 28 lessons changed on the branch); `npm run test:lifehacks` 64/64; `npm run check`; `npx tsc --noEmit`. Results in the commit message.

## Template change v2 (r11 fix plan, 2026-10-15, demo-builder)

- TP-5 (shared v1 queue stage, `StudyLesson.tsx`): the caption defines total waiting on the stage ("Total waiting: each job's start time, added up"); "Prereq" became "Run before input" and shows only when the lesson has a dependency; row labels read "10 min · due 60 · needs draft"; when the learner reaches the target order and it waits longer than the starting order, the reveal says so and names the goal (deadline or dependency). The explore hint no longer says "fixture". The lesson's own text is unchanged.
- **Claims:** c3 (displayed results and the reveal) reset to unverified, because the shared stage text changed. No other claim changed. Version → 2.
- **Checks:** QA contract phone and desktop passed on the dev server (`QA_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3711`); `npm run test:lifehacks`, `npm run check`, `npx tsc --noEmit` green.

## Revision B4 (content patch r2, 2026-10-16, demo-builder)

- Applied by demo-builder on branch lhfix-r2 (batch B4), rows from company/reviews/lifehacks-200/content-patch-2026-10-16-r2.md section 1, every old value asserted against disk before writing. Not merged: the change touches src/lib/lifehacks (tier 2, company/engineering/readiness/2026-10-16-lh-content-patch-r2-b4.md, awaiting principal-engineer-ops).
- Title and/or hook replaced as the patch row gives it (no question, option or key change). Reset: the claim quoting them (c1 Study, c4 Home).
- TP-8 across W9 after this patch (own count from studyCatalog): key at index 0 in 5 of 13, index 1 in 7, index 2 in 1. No position holds the key in more than 9 of 13.
- QA contract on a release build (NEXT_DIST_DIR=.next-lhfix, QA_PORT=4051, QA_ONLY = the 33 touched lessons, 2 workers): this lesson passed on phone and desktop (74 passed; the only 2 failures were feed.spec "subject chips filter the feed", which compares against the QA_ONLY subset and passes 10/10 when run without QA_ONLY).
