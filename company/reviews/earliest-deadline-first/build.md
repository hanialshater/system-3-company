# Build note: earliest-deadline-first

## Template change v2 (r11 fix plan, 2026-10-15, demo-builder)

- TP-5 (shared v1 queue stage, `StudyLesson.tsx`): the caption defines total waiting on the stage ("Total waiting: each job's start time, added up"); "Prereq" became "Run before input" and shows only when the lesson has a dependency; row labels read "10 min · due 60 · needs draft"; when the learner reaches the target order and it waits longer than the starting order, the reveal says so and names the goal (deadline or dependency). The explore hint no longer says "fixture". The lesson's own text is unchanged.
- **Claims:** c3 (displayed results and the reveal) reset to unverified, because the shared stage text changed. No other claim changed. Version → 2.
- **Checks:** QA contract phone and desktop passed on the dev server (`QA_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3711`); `npm run test:lifehacks`, `npm run check`, `npx tsc --noEmit` green.
