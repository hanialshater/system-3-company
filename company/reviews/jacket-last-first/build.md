# Build note: jacket-last-first

Kept from evaluators until they report.

## Revision lhfix-r3 (dispatch 2026-10-16-r5-lifehacks.md B1, 2026-10-16, demo-builder)

- Branch lhfix-r3 from main 422f861. Tier 2: company/engineering/readiness/2026-10-16-lh-content-patch-r3.md, awaiting principal-engineer-ops; not merged. No claim marked verified by me.
- Applied, commit 764ef10: patch r2 §2 (company/reviews/lifehacks-200/content-patch-2026-10-16-r2.md, as amended by patch r3 "§2 re-check") title `Jacket, sweater, shoes`, hook `You'll want the jacket first. Where in the bag should it go?`.
- Reset: c4. The neutral picture row (W-1299) was already on main from lh-engine-locked; not touched here. W-1339/W-1323 (spec R2 conflict) is lane 6's.
- QA: release build of this branch (NEXT_DIST_DIR=.next-lh3, port 4073, QA_ONLY = the 21 touched lessons, 2 workers): this lesson's contract passed on phone and desktop (42 of 42 contract tests; the only 2 failures were feed.spec "subject chips filter the feed", which compares against the QA_ONLY subset and passes 10/10 without it). Dist deleted.

## Revision v1 → v2 (r11 fix plan wave W3, TP-1/TP-2/TP-8, 2026-10-16, demo-builder)

- engine: 2. Question and options from the plan; starting count 3 items (jacket, sweater, shoes), extra items go between sweater and shoes.
- Picture (r11 finding 1): a top-opening bag drawn as a vertical stack with the item names; the jacket is marked; arrows show the items that must come off it. B reverses the stack.
- Seen table (findings 2, 3): "On top of the jacket" 2 items / 0 items, live with the count.
- Claims: every claim reset to unverified (checkedBy/checkedOn removed, reset note in each source); new `.seen` claim for the first reveal sentence. Nothing marked verified. Version bumped.
- Correct option: The shoes, moved from 2nd to 1st of 3 (TP-8).
- Reveal: 90 words or fewer (counted on the built reveal at the starting value).
- QA contract on a production build (`next build`, NEXT_DIST_DIR=.next-lhw3, QA_PORT=3811, harness stamp clean, contract commit 3b97991): phone and desktop passed.
